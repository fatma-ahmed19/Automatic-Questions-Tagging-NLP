# Automatic-Questions-Tagging-NLP
This repository contains the implementation of an automatic question tagging system using various machine learning models. The goal of this project is to classify text data into different tags by preparing and preprocessing the dataset, extracting features using TF-IDF vectorization, and training/testing different machine learning models.
